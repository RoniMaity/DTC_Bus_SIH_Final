      <h2>History of DTC</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>Government of India, Ministry of Transport took over the local bus services of Delhi in May 1948 in the name of Delhi Transport Service when they found that the services offered by Gwalior and Northern India Transport Company Ltd., the then licensee, were inadequate. A Delhi Road Transport Authority was constituted under the Road Transport Corporation Act, 1950. This Authority became undertaking of Municipal Corporation of Delhi by an Act of Parliament in April, 1958.
  On the recommendation of a Working Group of Planning Commission which concluded that Delhi Transport as an extension of Municipal Corporation of Delhi had not been functioning efficiently and adequately resulting in leakage of revenue and very high operation cost, Govt. of India took over the management of the undertaking by passing the Delhi Road Transport Laws (Amendment) Act, in 1971. It took over the assets and liabilities from the erstwhile Delhi Transport Undertaking (DTU) operated by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi till 2nd Nov,1971. Thus the DTC was set up in 1971.</p>
  <p>In section 22 of the Road Transport Corporation Act, 1950, following objectives were laid down for the DTC:</p>
  <ul>
    
  <li style="text-align: left">To provide or secure or promote an efficient, economical, reliable and properly coordinated system the road transport in Union Territory of Delhi and any extended area.</li>
  <li style="text-align: left;">In doing so, it shall act on business principles.</li>
  <li style="text-align: left">To achieve a high level operational efficiency.</li>
  <li style="text-align: left">To charge fares not exceeding those prescribed by the State Under Section 43(1)(i) of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1939.</li>
  <li style="text-align: left">To attain financial self-sufficiency</li>.
  <li style="text-align: left">DTC which was functioning under the administrative control of Govt. of India, was finally taken over by Govt. of NCT, Delhi on 05.08.1996.</li>
  
  </ul>

    <h2>Services</h2>
    <p>DTC has an extensive network of bus routes spread all over Delhi. A few routes also go into the neighboring cities of Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, and Faridabad. As of June 2023, of the 606 total bus routes in Delhi, 259 were operated by DTC, 209 were operated by DIMTS, and 138 routes were operated on by both the authorities under the Department of Transport's 'Unified Time Table'.</p><b>These routes are serviced by 7,135 buses, with 4,088 of them under DTC, out of 37 depots and 3 ISBTs</b> .<p> The average number of trips in FY 2021-22 was 31,084 per day. The number of routes being operated by the corporation has been steadily falling over the years under the Delhi government's policy of a 50:50 ratio of DTC buses and cluster buses on every route.
  
  DTC also provides various other services like night services, tourist services, and airport express services. It also provides buses to Delhi Police and used to do so for some schools (however, this was stopped in July 2022)</p>

  <h2>Depots</h2>
  <p>DTC operates its buses from 37 bus depots categorized into 4 regions: East, North, South & West. Each region is headed by a Regional Manager, and each depot is headed by a Depot Manager. 36 of these depots are located in Delhi, with 1 located in the neighboring city of Noida. These facilities perform regular maintenance and cleaning of buses. To complement DTC's existing depots, Delhi government is constructing 9 new bus depots at Kirari, East Vinod Nagar 2, Narela, Daurala, Burari, Savda Ghevra, Kapashera, Gadaipur, and Chattarpur</p>
  <h2>Fact</h2>
  <p>As of September 2023, DTC has a fleet of 4,088 buses, with 3,288 CNG buses and 800 electric buses. This makes its fleet the largest CNG bus fleet in the world, and the largest electric bus fleet in India. The buses are dispatched from 37 bus depots across Delhi. With Delhi's having a total of 7,135 buses, this means that 57% of these belong to DTC.</p>
